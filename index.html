   <h3 class="heading">Here are interesting facts about Ada Lovelace:</h3>
   <ul id="tribute-info">
    <li><strong>Her birth</strong> <span>-</span> Ada Lovelace was born as Augusta Ada Byron, the only of Lord George Gordon Byron a poet and his wife Lady Annabella Byron a mathematician</li>
    <li><strong>Her childhood</strong> <span>-</span> She was hampered by ill-health throughout her childhood but this did not deter her education.  Ada excelled in science and mathematics from an early age</li>
    <li><strong>Her marriage</strong> <span>-</span> At 19 she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King. He was later made Earl of Lovelace, affording her the name she is now commonly known by</li>
    <li><strong>Her mentor</strong> <span>-</span> In 1833, Ada was introduced to Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor. He went on to become her mentor, arranged her tuition in advanced mathematics by University of London professor Augustus de Morgan, and first introduced her to his various mathematical inventions.</li>
    <li><strong>Her work</strong> <span>-</span> While Ada was translating a French transcript of one of Babbageâ€™s lectures into English, she added her own section where she described an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. Over a century after her death, her notes were confirmed to be the description of a computer and software. For this reason Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer</li>
